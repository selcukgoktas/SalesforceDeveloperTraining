# Contents

## APEX and APEX TEST

### APEX 1 (BusinessToCustommer) - Create Account and Contact Together
We know the person account but we don't prefer to use it in this scenario. So we create an apex class to create account and contact together with the same name. 

### TEST 1 (BusinessToCustommerTest) - Create Account and Contact Apex Class Test
We have an apex class which name is **BusinessToCustommer** and we have method to create account and contact together in place of person account. ( without using person account ) . For this test Class we are going to test this apex class.


## APEX TRIGGER

### Trigger1 - Empty Trigger template

You can use this trigger for every purpose. Just change the related object and use it.
It contains **switch when** expression. It's metadata file make this **trigger inactive**.
If you want to make this activated you should go to the object manager related object and check triggers is active or not.
You can also change metadata file to activate trigger before deployment.


### Trigger2 - Account Trigger
This is an interview Question for Google Salesforce Developer.

### Trigger3 - Account Trigger
v1 - Simple Before update make the account name toUpperCase()
v2 - Do the same thing with trigger helper file and add phone field error.

### Trigger4 - Lead Trigger
With this trigger we will check the phone field of the Lead record then if it is empty we will create a task to the lead owner. 
Trigger and Trigger Helper file will handle the job together.  We have 2 option with trigger.new and trigger.newMap. So we create 2 method to read the triggered lead records. Then use another method to create task. 

### Trigger5 - Account Trigger
Empty Trigger template to show the differences between switch on operation type when and if isbefore isafter

### Trigger6 - Contact Trigger
If there is no phone on the contact record get phone from related account record and update phone field. 

### Trigger7 - Opportunity Trigger
Opportunity Stage cannot be set as previous stages. Only one exception. If user has a specific profile he can set previous stage only if stage is close lost..

### ASYNC Apex

Async apex has more governor limits. You can work with millions of data some of them. You can check details on the [this link](<https://selcukgoktas.github.io/Salesforce-Developer-Guide/Salesforce%20Developer%20(Module)/APEX%20Async%2083ade181e8164901995d57ec616ae221.html>)

### ASYNC1 - Future Method
